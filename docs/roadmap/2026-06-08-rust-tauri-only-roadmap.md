# Rust/Tauri Implementation Roadmap

Status: archived planning snapshot

This roadmap is superseded by
[the 2026-06-15 parity remediation roadmap](2026-06-15-rust-tauri-parity-remediation-roadmap.html.md).

The current planning hub is
[implementation-backlog.md](./implementation-backlog.md).

**Last Updated**: 2026-06-14
**Status**: archived implementation backlog
**Objective**: make `tachi-rust` a Rust + Tauri only repository through
Beads-ready execution slices

## Executive Summary

This roadmap is the archived canonical sequencing document for the original
Rust/Tauri-only transition. Later parity, security, MCP, SARIF, and toolchain
roadmaps supersede the active execution state. This file keeps the original
roadmap artifacts as source-of-truth history,
adds a navigation hub in [implementation-backlog.md](./implementation-backlog.md),
and anchors the merge sequence in
[2026-06-08-rust-tauri-only-merge-plan.md](./2026-06-08-rust-tauri-only-merge-plan.md).

The work is intentionally ordered:

1. Safety and parser hardening first.
1. Developer experience, packaging, and onboarding second.
1. Reporting, outputs, and rule-engine expansion third.
1. Ecosystem integrations and framework coverage fourth.
1. Performance, streaming, and formal assurance last.

The roadmap does not treat any stage as complete until its validation gate is
passed and the next stage can begin without reopening the previous one.

## Backlog Shape

The backlog is organized as:

`Epic -> Feature -> Capability -> Task -> Function`

- `Epic` captures the migration outcome.
- `Feature` groups work by crate or user-facing concern.
- `Capability` states the behavior that must exist.
- `Task` is the smallest TDD-driven slice.
- `Function` is the concrete function, command, fixture, or test seam.

The Beads-ready template for each task lives in
[implementation-backlog.md](./implementation-backlog.md), while the concrete
issue-card and merge-plan pointers stay in the canonical roadmap artifacts.

## Stage Plan

| Stage | Focus | Exit criterion |
|---|---|---|
| Stage 0 | Inventory and contract freeze | Every active parser, command, output, and documentation surface is mapped to an owner, a dependency, and a test seam before new implementation work starts. |
| Stage 1 | Safety and parser hardening | User-facing parsing paths fail deterministically, malformed Mermaid/PlantUML/C4 inputs are covered by fixtures, and no parse-path panic remains. |
| Stage 2 | Developer experience, packaging, and onboarding | Cargo-first installation, CLI ergonomics, completions, and onboarding docs reflect the real Rust/Tauri workflow without Python packaging assumptions. |
| Stage 3 | Reporting, outputs, and rule-engine expansion | Report payloads, scoring, taxonomy, and output shapes are stable under fixtures and snapshot-style checks. |
| Stage 4 | Ecosystem integrations and framework coverage | Shared command dispatch, desktop bridge behavior, and framework-facing integrations stay parity-aligned. |
| Stage 5 | Performance, streaming, and formal assurance | Benchmark gates, invariant checks, and regression proofs protect the hardened Rust-only path from performance or behavior drift. |

Do not start a later stage until the current stage has satisfied its exit
criterion and the relevant validation matrix.

## TDD Policy

- Write the failing test before production code.
- Verify red before green.
- Keep each slice minimal until it passes.
- Validate at the function, task, capability, feature, and epic levels.
- Prefer small, mergeable Beads items over broad change sets.
- Re-run the progressive validation after every slice, not only at the end of a
  stage.

## Validation Matrix

| Work type | Proof required | Typical test seam |
|---|---|---|
| Parser work | Unit tests plus integration fixtures | Parser modules and malformed fixture sets |
| CLI and config work | Command-level tests plus config parsing tests | `tachi-cli` entrypoints |
| Tauri work | Bridge parity tests plus desktop smoke checks | `src-tauri` command registration |
| Reporting work | Output-shape checks plus snapshot-style regression tests | `tachi-core` builders |
| Ecosystem work | Cross-component parity checks | `tachi-shell` and `src-tauri` bridge paths |
| Performance work | Benchmark or criterion gate | Hot-path functions and regressions |
| Docs work | Readability, consistency, and link checks | Roadmap and onboarding docs |

## Dependency Rules

- Parser hardening must land before rule-engine expansion.
- CLI config stability must land before completions and release packaging work.
- Reporting and output contracts must stabilize before integrations that rely
  on those artifacts.
- Ecosystem integrations must stay behind the shared shell and desktop bridge.
- Performance and formal assurance come last, after behavioral contracts are
  stable.
- Capture dependencies at the feature or capability level whenever possible.
  Do not mirror every internal call edge in Beads.

**Primary owner**: `tachi-core`
**Stage**: Stage 1

### Feature 1.1 - Diagram parser boundary safety

| Capability | Tasks | Functions |

| Shell and CLI propagation preserves parser failures as structured errors. | Thread parse results through `tachi-shell` and `tachi-cli`; avoid lossy conversion into generic exits; verify the same error is visible from every caller. | `map_error`, `serialize_payload`, `deserialize_input` |

### Feature 1.3 - Parser fixtures and contract coverage

| Capability | Tasks | Functions |
|---|---|---|

### Feature 2.2 - Cargo-first packaging and bootstrap flow

| Capability | Tasks | Functions |
|---|---|---|
| Workspace build and bootstrap paths use the Rust toolchain as the canonical install path. | Remove Python packaging assumptions from the active path; make build/test/bootstrap commands work from Cargo entrypoints; lock down release packaging checks. | `cargo build`, `cargo test`, `cargo run` |
| Packaging behavior is documented against the actual workspace layout. | Align install, update, and bootstrap docs with the Rust workspace; keep release notes and onboarding examples current; verify that the documented path matches the shell. | `validate_packaging_contract`, `render_bootstrap_steps`, `check_release_manifest` |

### Feature 2.3 - Onboarding and documentation

### Feature 5.3 - Formal assurance and regression gates

| Capability | Tasks | Functions |
|---|---|---|
| Benchmarks become part of the release gate. | Record the benchmark thresholds; keep performance regression checks in the repo; refuse to merge a slowdown without an explicit review. | `assert_regression_budget`, `run_criterion_benchmark`, `record_benchmark_baseline` |
| Invariants and contract tests protect the hardened path. | Add property tests or invariants where they buy confidence; keep the contracts narrow; verify that the behavior remains reproducible. | `verify_contract_invariants`, `compare_regression_fixture`, `assert_behavioral_invariant` |

## Execution Notes

- Start with Stage 0 inventory work and do not begin implementation slices
  until the inventory is frozen.
- Keep each Beads item small enough to complete in one TDD loop.
- Use the issue pack for tracker-neutral baselines and the issue cards for
  concrete task templates.
- Re-check the roadmap and issue-card pointers whenever the backlog changes so
  the navigation hub stays current.
