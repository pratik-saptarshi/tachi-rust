# Adversarial Architecture and Test Quality Issue Cards

**Last Updated**: 2026-06-22
**Status**: completed historical execution slices for the 2026-06-22 roadmap
**Source**: [2026-06-22-adversarial-architecture-test-quality-roadmap.html.md](./2026-06-22-adversarial-architecture-test-quality-roadmap.html.md)

These cards were copy-paste-ready Beads issues. Every card was TDD-first:
write or preserve the failing test/gate proof, then implement the smallest
slice that makes it pass. Future architecture/test-quality work should open new
Beads cards instead of reusing this completed set.

- `Capability`
- `Task`
