# AISVS Dependabot Remediation Roadmap

**Date**: 2026-06-23
**Scope**: historical Dependabot alert set, AISVS 1.0 control framework, and
TDD-backed backlog slices for `tachi-rust`
**Status**: completed active roadmap; retained as the historical execution
record for the closed `RT-00i` Beads hierarchy

## Executive summary

The historical Dependabot alert surface had one runtime advisory: `glib`
`0.18.5` was vulnerable in the retired adapter lockfile, with the patched line
at `0.20.0`. The alert was transitive through the old desktop stack
(`src-tauri` depended on `tauri`, and the lockfile resolved `gio` / `glib` /
`gtk` `0.18.x` packages). The workspace has since moved to the GTK-free
`crates/tachi-desktop` host and retired the buildable `src-tauri` adapter
manifest, lockfile, and compatibility workflow.

In parallel, the repository needs an AISVS 1.0 control framework that is
complementary to the existing OWASP-oriented security surfaces. The framework
should make AISVS C01-C12 explicit in Rust types, validation seams, tests, and
release gates so future security controls are incremental instead of ad hoc.

Current implementation status:

- Phase 0 is closed: the active workspace and checked-in lockfiles no longer
  expose a buildable GTK/Wry/Tauri adapter path with `glib 0.18.5`.
- Phases 1-4 are already implemented locally in `crates/tachi-core/src/aisvs.rs`
  with targeted tests in `crates/tachi-core/tests/aisvs_registry.rs` and
  `crates/tachi-core/tests/aisvs_controls.rs`.
- Phase 5 is active: publish-readiness now depends on the BOM, checklist, CI,
  and Beads export staying synchronized after each slice.

## Historical alert analysis

| Alert | Current state | Package path | Fixed version | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 16 | closed | retired `src-tauri/Cargo.lock` -> legacy `tauri` / `gtk` host path | `glib 0.20.0` | Unsound iterator implementation in `glib::VariantStrIter` can trigger undefined behavior and crashes |

### Immediate remediation objective

1. Keep the workspace desktop surface on the GTK-free host boundary.
1. Retire the adapter manifest and lockfile so the vulnerable `glib 0.18.5`
   package disappears from the tracked dependency surfaces.
1. Validate the update with workspace tests, the new desktop-host tests, clippy,
   and the existing release-readiness gates.
1. Record the alert closure and keep the proof archived for historical review.

## Adversarial review integration

The review pass surfaced one documentation gap and one structural blocker that
needed to be made explicit in the roadmap:

| Finding | Severity | Category | Remediation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Roadmap status drifted from the live repo state | MEDIUM | Correction | Replace "implementation pending" with the actual phase status so future readers do not treat implemented control phases as work still needing build-out. |
| Phase 0 closure still needs adapter retirement proof | HIGH | Gap | Use `RT-00i.2.5` to remove the buildable `src-tauri` adapter surface; the future recheck lane was later deleted after workspace proof showed no `glib` package; do not reintroduce the GTK/Wry stack into the workspace member set. |

This roadmap already contains the necessary Beads graph, but the phase narrative
and status text must stay aligned with the tracker and the local implementation
state.

## Roadmap model

`Epic -> Capability -> Feature -> Task -> Function`

- `Epic` states the security outcome.
- `Capability` names the control family or containment result.
- `Feature` groups work by remediable slice.
- `Task` is the smallest TDD-first change set.
- `Function` names the concrete module, command, workflow, or test seam.

## Phase 0: Contain the Dependabot alert

| Layer | Mapping |
|---|---|
| Epic | `RT-00i` AISVS framework and Dependabot remediation |
| Capability | Supply-chain containment for the historical `glib` alert |
| Feature | `RT-00i.2` Replace workspace Tauri host with GTK-free boundary |
| Tasks | `RT-00i.2.1` reproduce alert, `RT-00i.2.2` add GTK-free host boundary, `RT-00i.2.5` retire adapter surface, `RT-00i.2.3` verify alert closure |
| Functions | `Cargo.toml`, `crates/tachi-desktop/`, `Cargo.lock`, retired `src-tauri` manifest/lockfile/workflow, `Makefile publish-gate`, `Makefile scaffold-dependency-gate` |

**TDD acceptance criteria**

- Add or preserve a failing proof that captures the vulnerable `glib 0.18.5`
  lockfile state before the host split.
- Make the smallest workspace change that removes the remaining buildable
  GTK/Wry/Tauri adapter path from tracked dependency surfaces.
- Keep the desktop host and workspace tests green after the split.
- Prove the Dependabot alert is closed or reduced to a documented, explicit
  exception.

## Phase 1: AISVS framework foundation

| Layer | Mapping |
|---|---|
| Epic | `RT-00i` |
| Capability | AISVS 1.0 control registry and error model |
| Feature | `RT-00i.1` Introduce typed AISVS control registry |
| Tasks | define control ids, control families, typed states, and a safe error enum |
| Functions | `crates/tachi-core/src/aisvs.rs`, `crates/tachi-core/tests/aisvs_registry.rs`, `crates/tachi-core/src/lib.rs`, `crates/tachi-core/src/facade.rs` |

**TDD acceptance criteria**

- Invalid control states are unrepresentable at compile time.
- The error enum uses `thiserror`-style composition and does not leak internal
  model strings, credentials, or system details.
- The registry covers AISVS C01-C12 and is `Send + Sync` friendly.
- Tests prove lookup, invalid-state rejection, and serialization/deserialization
  behavior before the implementation lands.

**Status**

- Implemented locally with typed control ids, a sanitized error enum, and
  failing-first registry tests.

## Phase 2: AISVS C01-C04 control cluster

| Layer | Mapping |
|---|---|
| Epic | `RT-00i` |
| Capability | Training-data, input, lifecycle, and infrastructure controls |
| Feature | `RT-00i.3` Implement AISVS C01-C04 control cluster |
| Tasks | training-data traceability, user-input validation, lifecycle gating, infrastructure hardening |
| Functions | `crates/tachi-core/src/aisvs.rs` |

**TDD acceptance criteria**

- C01 tests prove third-party data provenance and integrity metadata are
  validated before use.
- C02 tests prove invalid prompt/input states fail before execution.
- C03 tests prove lifecycle transitions are typed and cannot skip gates.
- C04 tests prove infrastructure policy surfaces are explicit and testable.

**Status**

- Implemented locally in `crates/tachi-core/src/aisvs.rs` with
  `crates/tachi-core/tests/aisvs_controls.rs`.
- The control slice is intentionally narrow and typed, with parse-time
  rejection for invalid inputs and explicit transition-policy tests.

## Phase 3: AISVS C05-C08 control cluster

| Layer | Mapping |
|---|---|
| Epic | `RT-00i` |
| Capability | Identity, supply chain, model behavior, and memory controls |
| Feature | `RT-00i.5` Implement AISVS C05-C08 control cluster |
| Tasks | access-control policy, supply-chain verification, behavior constraints, memory/embeddings controls |
| Functions | `crates/tachi-core/src/aisvs.rs` |

**TDD acceptance criteria**

- C05 tests prove identity and authorization decisions are explicit and
  composable.
- C06 tests prove model/artifact supply-chain evidence is required and audited.
- C07 tests prove unsafe or policy-breaking behavior is rejected by typed state.
- C08 tests prove memory and embedding surfaces remain bounded and validated.

**Status**

- Implemented locally in `crates/tachi-core/src/aisvs.rs` with
  `crates/tachi-core/tests/aisvs_controls.rs`.
- The phase-3 slice keeps explicit access, supply-chain, behavior, and memory
  contracts typed and bounded.

## Phase 4: AISVS C09-C12 control cluster

| Layer | Mapping |
|---|---|
| Epic | `RT-00i` |
| Capability | Orchestration, MCP security, robustness, and monitoring |
| Feature | `RT-00i.4` Implement AISVS C09-C12 control cluster |
| Tasks | orchestration approval, MCP security, adversarial robustness, monitoring/logging |
| Functions | `crates/tachi-core/src/aisvs.rs` |

**TDD acceptance criteria**

- C09 tests prove orchestration permissions and escalation boundaries stay
  explicit.
- C10 tests prove MCP transport, schema, and message validation are covered.
- C11 tests prove adversarial robustness cases have failing-first tests and
  targeted regressions.
- C12 tests prove monitoring and audit outputs are redaction-safe and stable.

**Status**

- Implemented locally in `crates/tachi-core/src/aisvs.rs` with
  `crates/tachi-core/tests/aisvs_controls.rs`.
- The phase-4 slice keeps orchestration, MCP, adversarial, and monitoring
  controls typed and fail-closed.

## Phase 5: Publish-readiness and release gates

| Layer | Mapping |
|---|---|
| Epic | `RT-00i` |
| Capability | Publish gate and alert monitoring |
| Feature | CI and docs readiness for the AISVS framework |
| Tasks | update publish checklist, BOM, release monitoring, and Beads follow-ups |
| Functions | `docs/bill-of-materials.html.md`, `docs/publish-readiness-checklist.html.md`, `.github/workflows/fuzz-mutation-audit.yml`, `.github/workflows/rust-workspace.yml`, `.github/workflows/rust-clippy.yml` |

**TDD acceptance criteria**

- The publish checklist names the new AISVS and advisory security gates.
- The BOM lists the AISVS roadmap and the advisory fuzz/mutation lane.
- GitHub Actions remains green after each slice.
- Any new survivors or regressions become explicit Beads issues before merge.

## Sequencing

1. Keep the Phase 0 host split explicit until the GTK-free desktop boundary is
   the permanent published baseline.
1. Preserve the already-implemented AISVS foundation and control clusters as
   the canonical local state.
1. Land any future AISVS deltas as separate TDD slices using the existing
   Beads task graph and acceptance criteria.
1. Keep the BOM, publish checklist, and `bd export` synchronized after each
   slice and before any release push.

## Implementation checkpoints

### Checkpoint A: host containment

- Keep `RT-00i.2.5` and the closed `RT-00i.7` decision note as the evidence
  trail for the GTK-free desktop host split.
- Re-run `cargo tree -i glib --locked --target all` and the workspace gates
  after any desktop-host change.
- Do not reintroduce GTK/Wry into the workspace member set.

### Checkpoint B: typed AISVS framework

- Keep the AISVS control registry and sanitized error model as the canonical
  foundation for C01-C12.
- Preserve the `Send + Sync` and invalid-state rejection invariants already
  covered by tests.
- Add future control slices only as separate TDD-backed phases.

### Checkpoint C: publish readiness

- Keep `docs/bill-of-materials.html.md` and
  `docs/publish-readiness-checklist.html.md` synchronized with the roadmap and
  Beads export.
- Require `make publish-gate` plus post-push GitHub Actions monitoring before a
  release is considered complete.
- Keep docs-sweep and archived roadmap references clearly labeled historical.

## Definition of done

- The Dependabot alert is closed or explicitly documented as accepted.
- AISVS C01-C12 exist as typed, test-backed controls in the Rust workspace.
- The roadmap and Beads tracker expose the exact validation commands for each
  slice.
- No secrets, private paths, or customer data enter the plan, tests, or docs.
