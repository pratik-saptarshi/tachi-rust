# Rust/Tauri Implementation Issue Cards

**Last Updated**: 2026-06-15
**Status**: archived execution backlog
**Source**: [2026-06-08-rust-tauri-only-roadmap.md](./2026-06-08-rust-tauri-only-roadmap.md)

This card set is retained for provenance only. The current planning hub is
[implementation-backlog.md](./implementation-backlog.md).

These cards are the task-sized execution slices for the roadmap in
[implementation-backlog.md](./implementation-backlog.md). They are intentionally
small and owner-aligned; do not copy them into Beads unless a new reconciliation
pass explicitly reopens the historical scope.

## Card Format

Every card includes:

- `Epic`
- `Feature`
- `Capability bundle`
- `Task`
- `Function`
- `Dependencies`
- `Acceptance criteria`
- `Validation`
- `Implementation owner`
- `Stage label`
- `Next test seam`
- `Notes`
