# Bill of Materials

**Status**: Active publish inventory
**Last Updated**: 2026-07-05
**Purpose**: enumerate the repository surfaces that are expected to ship, be
reviewed, or be validated before publishing `tachi-rust` to remote origin
**Scope**: source code, docs, tests, CI, security posture, and release gates

## Publish Model

`tachi-rust` publishes as a Rust workspace with `crates/tachi-desktop` as the
active GTK-free desktop host, a transitional Tauri compatibility adapter, and
documentation-first release controls. The public surface is intentionally broad
because the repository ships:

- Rust workspace code and shared command logic
- GTK-free desktop host code
- Transitional Tauri compatibility code
- CLI entrypoints
- docs, roadmap, and release policy artifacts
- security and privacy posture documentation
- CI and secret-scanning workflows
- test fixtures and regression data

This BOM is the authoritative inventory for publication review. If a file or
directory is not listed here, it is either internal implementation detail,
temporary scratch state, or a local-only worktree artifact.

For public readers, this document explains which surfaces are expected to ship,
which docs define the user-facing workflow, and which validation gates guard
the release path. Treat it as the contract between repository contents and the
published artifact set.

## Public-Facing Documents

These are the documents that must stay current, redaction-safe, and aligned
with the shipped release workflow before publication.

| Path | Role | Publish status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `README.md` | Repository landing page and getting-started guide | Publishable | Must describe the current install, usage, auditor workflow, and release path without stale workflow guidance. |
| `adapters/README.md` | Compatibility entrypoint for native adapters and generic fallback | Publishable | Must match the harness matrix, install surfaces, and identical core contract. |
| `docs/platform-compatibility.md` | Harness matrix and fallback behavior guide | Publishable | Must stay aligned with the adapter packs and the generic fallback path. |
| `docs/guides/DEVELOPER_GUIDE_TACHI.md` | Public developer and auditor walkthrough | Publishable | Must stay aligned with the README and show the actual first-run analysis path. |
| `SECURITY.md` | Security policy | Publishable | Private vulnerability reporting only; keep public disclosure guidance current. |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Release history | Publishable | Redaction-safe release notes only. |
| `docs/bill-of-materials.html.md` | Publish inventory | Publishable | Canonical inventory of publication surfaces and validation gates. |
| `docs/publish-readiness-checklist.html.md` | Publish readiness checklist | Publishable | Required pre-push gate for security, privacy, docs, CI, release hygiene, and public-doc alignment. Must describe `crates/tachi-desktop` as the active desktop host. |

## Security and Privacy BOM

The following surfaces require explicit review before publication:

- Any file that may contain tokens, credentials, private keys, or API secrets.
- Any example, fixture, or log that may contain customer data, personal data,
  or private assessment output.
- Any workflow that can emit secrets into logs or artifacts.
- Any documentation that describes private internal process, unreleased release
  state, or unredacted operational details.

The repository policy for these surfaces is:

1. Keep secrets out of committed files.
1. Keep public examples synthetic or redacted.
1. Route security issues through private disclosure, not public issue trackers.
1. Re-scan before publish and again after release merges.
1. Keep `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and all release-facing docs free of private paths, tokens, usernames, and unredacted operational details.

## Validation BOM

| Gate | Evidence | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| Rust unit and integration tests | `cargo test -q` | Must pass cleanly. |
| Rust toolchain proof | `rustup toolchain install --no-self-update`, `rustc -Vv`, `cargo -Vv`, `which rustc`, `which cargo`, `rustup which rustc` | Required Rust workflows consume `rust-toolchain.toml` and prove the compiler path before running tests or lint. |
| Full workspace PR behavior gate | `cargo test --workspace --all-targets` and `.github/workflows/rust-workspace.yml` | Pull requests run the whole Rust workspace without path filters. |
| Rust e2e and bridge checks | `cargo test -p tachi-shell --test init_substitution` and `cargo test -p tachi-core --test rt009_docs` | Must pass for CLI/tidy report contract parity surfaces. |
| MCP scaffold and contract checks | `cargo test -p tachi-mcp --test contract_snapshot --test schema_snapshot --test tools_registration --test session_policy --test stdio` and `cargo build -p tachi-mcp --features stdio` | MCP registry, stdio transport, request-id continuity, cancellation handling, schema snapshots, and contract snapshots remain deterministic. |
| Core infographic and scaffold seams | `cargo test -p tachi-core` | Prompt scaffold, infographic payload, parser, and reporting seams remain green after boundary splits. |
| Infographic payload seam | `cargo test -p tachi-core` | Payload orchestration remains behavior-compatible after moving filesystem loading and template assembly. |
| Parser hardening regression | `cargo test -p tachi-core compute_delta_counts_trims_case_and_ignores_unknown_statuses -- --nocapture` | Must pass for panic-free delta counting and status normalization. |
| Lint gate | `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` and `.github/workflows/rust-clippy.yml` | No warnings allowed; SARIF upload remains `if: always()` but clippy status fails closed. |
| Supply-chain gate | `cargo audit`, `cargo deny check advisories bans licenses sources`, `make supply-chain-gate`, and `.github/workflows/rust-supply-chain.yml` | RustSec advisories, dependency bans, license policy, and registry/source policy pass locally and in CI with pinned helper tools. |
| Coverage gate | `make llvm-cov` | Coverage remains above the repo floor; validated at 85.55% line coverage on 2026-07-05. |
| Reporting goldens | `cargo test -p tachi-core --test reporting_goldens -- --nocapture` | Canonical report, threat, risk, coverage, and infographic outputs remain stable through semantic projections and compact snapshots. |
| Advisory fuzz/mutation lane | `make fuzz-mutation-gate` and `.github/workflows/fuzz-mutation-audit.yml` | Commands stay documented, scheduled/manual runs remain non-blocking, and survivor reports stay offline-safe. |
| Diff hygiene | `git diff --check` | No whitespace or patch-format issues. |
| Secret scan | `pre-commit run --all-files` or `gitleaks` / CI workflow | No secrets or private data leak into the publish set, including examples, fixtures, logs, and generated docs. |
| Scaffold dependency gate | `make scaffold-dependency-gate` | Next.js/Supabase scaffold dependency ranges exclude currently known vulnerable `next` and `vitest` floors. |
| Docs gate | `README.md`, `docs/platform-compatibility.md`, `docs/guides/DEVELOPER_GUIDE_TACHI.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and public docs cross-links | Public docs match the shipped behavior and the disclosure policy. |
| AISVS security gate | `cargo test -p tachi-core --test aisvs_registry`, `cargo test -p tachi-core --test aisvs_controls`, `cargo test -p tachi-core --test scaffold_dependency_floors`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-features --all-targets -- -D warnings` | AISVS C01-C12 remain typed, test-backed, and fail-closed while the live `glib` advisory proof stays reproducible in Beads, the registry exposes stable per-control validation commands, and the desktop workspace stays on the GTK-free host path. |
| AISVS publish-readiness follow-up | `RT-00i.6` | The Phase 5 docs/release-gate follow-up stays visible in the BOM and issue cards so publish-readiness work keeps pace with each control slice. |
| Docs/version sweep | `make docs-version-gate` + `make docs-archive-version-gate` | Maintained docs stay current; archived docs and examples retain only intentional historical references. |
| Publish gate | `make publish-gate` | The release candidate passes the full local publish-readiness suite before remote publication. |
| CI gate | GitHub Actions run status | Release, security, lint, and docs workflows are green. |
| Remote monitor | `git push origin main --follow-tags` + `gh run watch` | Post-push CI is observed to completion before the release is considered published. |
| Release-please gate | `release-please.yml` push filter | Docs-only publishes do not churn release refs and push runs avoid PR-branch churn. |
| Workflow hardening | `rg "actions/checkout@v[0-6]|actions-rs/toolchain@|github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3|::set-output" .github/workflows` | No legacy checkout, toolchain, SARIF, or set-output usage remains. |
| MCP readiness gate | MCP roadmap, MCP issue cards, BOM, publish checklist, and MCP CI lane | MCP publish surfaces stay in sync with the canonical command contract, release checklist, request-context hardening, portability matrix, and CI evidence before promotion. |
| MCP CI lane | `.github/workflows/rust-workspace.yml` with `tachi-mcp` package matrix | Dedicated MCP package lane covers contract snapshot, schema snapshot, stdio transport, and tool registration regressions. |

## Exclusions

- Local worktree scratch files.
- Generated caches that are ignored by git.
- Temporary benchmark data created outside the checked-in benchmark fixtures.
- Anything in the tree explicitly labeled archived, retired, or compatibility
  only, unless it is being published as historical evidence.

## Publish Rule

If a surface is listed as publishable, it must be reviewed for security,
privacy, doc accuracy, and release readiness before `main` is pushed to
`origin`.
