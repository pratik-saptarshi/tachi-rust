# Publish Readiness Checklist

**Status**: Active release gate
**Last Updated**: 2026-07-05
**Purpose**: confirm `tachi-rust` is ready to publish to `origin/main`
**Scope**: security, privacy, docs, tests, coverage, CI, and release hygiene

Use this checklist before publishing to GitHub or cutting a release. The
active desktop host is `crates/tachi-desktop`; `src-tauri` is transitional-only.
The transitional `src-tauri` adapter is explicitly excluded from the root
workspace and validated through `make tauri-adapter-check` / the manual or
scheduled adapter workflow, not through the required publish gate.

## 0. Canonical publish sequence

- [ ] `pre-commit run --all-files` or the equivalent `gitleaks` scan passes.
- [ ] `make publish-gate` passes on the release candidate branch.
- [ ] `cargo test -p tachi-shell` passes after the script executor boundary
      slice and coverage-invariant cleanup.
- [ ] `cargo test -p tachi-mcp --test contract_snapshot --test schema_snapshot --test tools_registration --test session_policy --test stdio`
      passes and the MCP scaffold builds with `cargo build -p tachi-mcp --features stdio`.
- [ ] `crates/tachi-mcp/tests/tools_registration.rs` and
      `crates/tachi-mcp/tests/stdio.rs` cover tool allowlisting, artifact
      emission, and stdio request/response handling.
- [ ] `crates/tachi-mcp/tests/session_policy.rs` covers request-id continuity
      and cancellation handling without artifact leakage.
- [ ] `make scaffold-dependency-gate` passes before publishing scaffold or template changes.
- [ ] `make fuzz-mutation-gate` passes and `.github/workflows/fuzz-mutation-audit.yml` remains scheduled/manual and non-blocking.
- [ ] Feature and coverage canaries are run serially when promoted for release
      evidence: `make feature-combination-canary`, then `make coverage-tool-proof`.
- [ ] `git push origin main --follow-tags` is the intended publish command.
- [ ] `gh run list --branch main --limit 10` is ready for post-push monitoring.
- [ ] `gh run watch <run-id>` will be used until the publish workflow completes.

## 1. Repository hygiene

- [ ] `git status --short --branch` is clean except for intentional, reviewed work.
- [ ] `git diff --check` passes.
- [ ] No untracked scratch files, temporary exports, or local-only artifacts are
      present in the publish set.
- [ ] The branch name and commit messages are conventional and self-explanatory.

## 2. Security and privacy

- [ ] No secrets, API keys, tokens, private keys, or credentials exist in the
      commit range to be published.
- [ ] No personal data, customer data, or private assessment output appears in
      examples, fixtures, screenshots, logs, or generated docs.
- [ ] Public-facing examples are synthetic, redacted, or already committed as
      safe fixtures.
- [ ] Security issues that are not safe for public disclosure stay in private
      vulnerability reporting.
- [ ] The BOM at [bill-of-materials.html.md](./bill-of-materials.html.md) was
      reviewed for any sensitive surfaces that need redaction.
- [ ] `README.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and the public docs under
      `docs/` do not leak private paths, credentials, internal-only status, or
      unreleased operational details.

## 3. Secret scanning

- [ ] `pre-commit run --all-files` passes, or the equivalent gitleaks command has
      been run successfully.
- [ ] The secret scan covers committed examples, fixtures, docs, generated
      reports, and workflow files.
- [ ] `.github/workflows/gitleaks.yml` is present and matches the local secret
      scan policy.
- [ ] Any legitimate placeholder or fixture match is documented and justified.
- [ ] No new warnings were introduced by hook configuration changes.
- [ ] `rg "actions/checkout@v[0-6]|actions-rs/toolchain@|github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3|::set-output" .github/workflows` returns no matches.

## 4. Rust validation

- [ ] `cargo test -q` passes.
- [ ] `Cargo.toml` declares workspace `rust-version = "1.96"` and active
      crates inherit it with `rust-version.workspace = true`.
- [ ] `rust-toolchain.toml` pins the approved release toolchain and includes
      `clippy`, `rustfmt`, and `llvm-tools-preview`.
- [ ] Required Rust workflows install the checked-in toolchain policy and print
      `rustc -Vv`, `cargo -Vv`, `which rustc`, `which cargo`, and
      `rustup which rustc`.
- [ ] `cargo audit` passes locally or in the equivalent
      `.github/workflows/rust-supply-chain.yml` gate.
- [ ] `cargo deny check advisories bans licenses sources` passes against
      `deny.toml`, and any future license/source exceptions include owner,
      expiry, issue, and remediation metadata.
- [ ] `cargo test --workspace --all-targets` passes or the equivalent
      `.github/workflows/rust-workspace.yml` PR gate is green.
- [ ] `src-tauri` remains listed in root `workspace.exclude`, has its own
      `src-tauri/Cargo.lock`, and `make tauri-adapter-check` passes when the
      transitional adapter compatibility surface is being changed.
- [ ] `cargo hack --version` reports `0.6.45`, `cargo llvm-cov --version`
      reports `0.8.7`, and `make feature-combination-canary` passes before any
      feature-combination canary is promoted to a required PR gate.
- [ ] Parser hardening regression tests pass, including delta-count normalization and panic-free status handling.
- [ ] Reporting goldens pass with semantic projections for coverage, report,
      threat, risk, and infographic outputs.
- [ ] Workflow CI gates pass with YAML-parsed event/job/matrix/step assertions
      and workspace-derived package matrix checks.
- [ ] [ADR-046](./architecture/02_ADRs/ADR-046-async-runtime-adoption-boundary.md)
      remains the async-runtime boundary: no `smol-rs` runtime dependency is
      added without a separate MCP or desktop feature, benchmarks,
      cancellation/shutdown tests, compatibility evidence, dependency diff, and
      rollback plan.
- [ ] `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` passes.
- [ ] `make llvm-cov` passes and the coverage floor remains above the project
      baseline; validated at 85.42% region coverage and 86.15% line coverage
      on 2026-07-05.
- [ ] Any benchmark or regression gate referenced by the roadmap has its current
      baseline recorded.
- [ ] `INSTALL_MANIFEST.md` only references files/directories that exist in the
      repository and expected install command paths.
- [ ] `make scaffold-dependency-gate` passes and blocks scaffold ranges that admit
      currently known vulnerable `next` or `vitest` versions.
- [ ] `make fuzz-mutation-gate` passes, the advisory fuzz/mutation workflow stays
      manual or scheduled, and its baseline report remains offline-safe.

## 5. Documentation readiness

- [ ] `README.md` matches the actual build, install, usage, and release path.
- [ ] `docs/platform-compatibility.md` matches the current harness matrix, support levels, install surfaces, and fallback behavior.
- [ ] `docs/guides/DEVELOPER_GUIDE_TACHI.md` matches the public README and
      explains the first analysis flow in plain language.
- [ ] `README.md`, `docs/platform-compatibility.md`, and
      `docs/guides/DEVELOPER_GUIDE_TACHI.md` describe the same standalone MCP
      server build, run, and validation contract.
- [ ] `adapters/README.md` matches the compatibility matrix and the canonical
      core contract.
- [ ] `crates/tachi-mcp/` is reflected in the BOM, install manifest, and
      release notes where the standalone MCP scaffold is public-facing.
- [ ] MCP request-context hardening is reflected in the BOM and checklist so
      Stage 2 transport policy stays visible while the server grows.
- [ ] `SECURITY.md` matches the current private-reporting and privacy policy.
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` is redaction-safe and reflects only releasable notes.
- [ ] `docs/roadmap/implementation-backlog.md` points at the archived AQ
      roadmap, active AISVS/security roadmap, closed docs-sweep/MCP/RT-TC
      records, and archived provenance docs.
- [ ] The AQ roadmap is archived at
      `docs/roadmap/2026-06-22-adversarial-architecture-test-quality-roadmap.html.md`.
- [ ] The active AISVS roadmap is
      `docs/roadmap/2026-06-23-aisvs-dependabot-remediation-roadmap.html.md`.
- [ ] The active AISVS scope and issue-card source is
      `docs/roadmap/2026-06-23-aisvs-dependabot-remediation-issue-cards.md`.
- [ ] The MCP roadmap and issue-card files are retained as historical records
      for the closed `MCP-001*` hierarchy:
      `docs/roadmap/2026-06-25-standalone-mcp-server-roadmap.html.md` and
      `docs/roadmap/2026-06-25-standalone-mcp-server-issue-cards.md`.
- [ ] Closed `RT-00i.6` remains the historical publish-readiness evidence for
      the AISVS roadmap; future AISVS release-gate deltas open new tracker
      slices instead of reusing the closed follow-up.
- [ ] The docs-sweep roadmap and issue-card files are retained as completed
      historical records:
      `docs/roadmap/2026-06-21-archived-docs-workflow-version-sweep-roadmap.html.md`
      and `docs/roadmap/2026-06-21-archived-docs-workflow-version-sweep-issue-cards.md`.
- [ ] The archived roadmap docs are clearly marked historical only.
- [ ] The roadmap and issue cards reflect the current phase sequencing, with
      closed AQ work retained as historical context.
- [ ] The live `glib` Dependabot alert proof is captured in
      `crates/tachi-core/tests/scaffold_dependency_floors.rs`, and
      `RT-00i.2` closes only when the GTK-free workspace no longer resolves
      `glib 0.18.5`.
- [ ] The AISVS registry exposes stable per-control validation commands, and
      the docs reference the registry-level contract instead of only the
      individual test names.
- [ ] The DOC-00X documentation-update plan remains separate from the parity
      and docs-sweep tracks.
- [ ] `docs/bill-of-materials.html.md` and `docs/publish-readiness-checklist.html.md`
      agree on the publish gate, security surfaces, and remote publication flow.
- [ ] `docs/bill-of-materials.html.md` includes the MCP roadmap and MCP issue
      cards as historical records for the closed `MCP-001*` hierarchy.
- [ ] The public README, compatibility doc, developer guide, BOM, and
      publish-security checklist describe the same install, analysis, adapter,
      and release workflow.
- [ ] Golden update policy is documented: semantic projections first, compact
      fixture-local snapshots second, and full-envelope equality only when a
      schema contract truly requires it.
- [ ] The shell executor seam is documented in the BOM and covered by focused
      shell crate tests.
- [ ] The infographic prompt scaffold seam is documented in the BOM and
      covered by focused core crate tests.
- [ ] The infographic payload seam is documented in the BOM and covered by
      focused core crate tests.
- [ ] `make docs-version-gate` passes.
- [ ] `make docs-archive-version-gate` passes.
- [ ] Public docs do not promise unsupported features or outdated workflows.
- [ ] `tachi-core` reporting and scoring consumers compile against root facade exports instead of module internals.
- [ ] Release notes, changelog entries, and user-facing examples are current and
      redaction-safe.

## 6. CI and GitHub readiness

- [ ] `.github/workflows/gitleaks.yml` is green for the publish branch.
- [ ] `.github/workflows/rust-workspace.yml` is green and is not
      path-filtered on pull requests.
- [ ] `.github/workflows/rust-workspace.yml` consumes `rust-toolchain.toml`
      instead of floating on `stable`.
- [ ] `.github/workflows/rust-workspace.yml` completes within the runner window via its package-sized test matrix.
- [ ] `.github/workflows/rust-workspace.yml` includes `tachi-mcp` in the
      package matrix and runs the MCP validation suite.
- [ ] `.github/workflows/rust-clippy.yml` is green.
- [ ] `.github/workflows/rust-clippy.yml` fails closed on warnings while still
      uploading SARIF with `if: always()`.
- [ ] `.github/workflows/rust-clippy.yml` consumes `rust-toolchain.toml`
      instead of overriding the repo pin with floating `stable`.
- [ ] `.github/workflows/rust-supply-chain.yml` is green and runs pinned
      `cargo-audit` and `cargo-deny` versions.
- [ ] `.github/workflows/tauri-adapter-compatibility.yml` stays manual or
      scheduled, uses the pinned repo toolchain, and is not a required
      PR/main-push gate while `crates/tachi-desktop` is the active host.
- [ ] `.github/workflows/rust-feature-coverage-canary.yml` stays manual or
      scheduled, installs pinned `cargo-hack` / `cargo-llvm-cov`, prints tool
      versions, and is not a required PR/main-push gate until reviewed.
- [ ] `.github/workflows/gitleaks.yml` fails closed after SARIF upload when
      scanner execution or SARIF validation fails.
- [ ] The latest main-push Actions run does not emit Node 20 deprecation warnings from the updated workflows.
- [ ] `.github/workflows/release-please.yml` ignores docs-only and roadmap-only
      pushes and does not churn release-PR branches on main pushes.
- [ ] `.github/workflows/tachi-mmdc-preflight.yml` is green.
- [ ] `.github/workflows/tachi-pytest.yml` is either retired or scoped strictly to
      transitional compatibility with a documented deprecation plan.
- [ ] The docs/version gate is green on the current branch.
- [ ] The release artifact gate and checksum matrix pass via `make publish-gate`.
- [ ] MCP roadmap, issue cards, BOM, and publish checklist remain synchronized
      as closed MCP evidence before any future MCP release promotion opens a
      new tracker hierarchy.
- [ ] `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` and `src-tauri/capabilities/main.json`
      remain least-privilege and do not grant filesystem or shell permissions
      without the corresponding AQ-022/AQ-023 policy tests. These files are
      transitional only, explicitly excluded from the root workspace, and
      validated through the standalone adapter lane.
- [ ] The scaffold dependency-floor audit passes via `make scaffold-dependency-gate`
      and is included in `make publish-gate`.
- [ ] Any release workflow required for the branch has succeeded or is queued
      without failures.
- [ ] GitHub Actions status was checked after the last merge or rebase.
- [ ] No workflow emits secrets, private paths, or private data into logs.

## 7. Remote publication

- [ ] The branch to publish is up to date with the intended base branch.
- [ ] The publish commit history is linear or intentionally merged.
- [ ] The push target is `origin/main` or a clearly named release branch.
- [ ] `make publish-gate` runs clean on the branch being published, including
      workflow drift, scaffold dependency-floor, and release artifact parity checks.
- [ ] The post-push CI monitor command is ready, for example:

```bash
gh run list --branch main --limit 10
gh run watch <run-id>
```
- [ ] The CI monitor runs until the relevant release, lint, security, and docs
      jobs all finish successfully.

## 8. Publish decision

- [ ] The repo is safe to publish.
- [ ] The repo is documented well enough for an outside reader to use.
- [ ] The repo is passing the required validation gates.
- [ ] The repo can be pushed to `origin` without exposing secrets or private
      material.

## Required exit criteria

Do not push to `origin/main` until all of the following are true:

1. Repository hygiene passes.
2. Security and privacy pass.
3. Secret scanning passes.
4. Rust validation passes.
5. Documentation is current.
6. GitHub Actions status is green or understood.

If any item fails, fix the failing gate first and rerun the checklist from the
top.
