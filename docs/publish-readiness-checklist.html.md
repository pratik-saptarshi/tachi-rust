# Publish Readiness Checklist

**Status**: Active release gate
**Last Updated**: 2026-06-15
**Purpose**: confirm `tachi-rust` is ready to publish to `origin/main`
**Scope**: security, privacy, docs, tests, coverage, CI, and release hygiene

Use this checklist before pushing `main` to remote origin or before promoting a
release candidate branch into `main`.

## 1. Repository hygiene

- [ ] `git status --short --branch` is clean except for intentional, reviewed work.
- [ ] `git diff --check` passes.
- [ ] No untracked scratch files, temporary exports, or local-only artifacts are
      present in the publish set.
- [ ] The branch name and commit messages are conventional and self-explanatory.

## 2. Security and privacy

- [ ] No secrets, API keys, tokens, private keys, or credentials exist in the
      commit range to be published.
- [ ] No personal data, customer data, or private assessment output appears in
      examples, fixtures, screenshots, logs, or generated docs.
- [ ] Public-facing examples are synthetic, redacted, or already committed as
      safe fixtures.
- [ ] Security issues that are not safe for public disclosure stay in private
      vulnerability reporting.
- [ ] The BOM at [bill-of-materials.html.md](./bill-of-materials.html.md) was
      reviewed for any sensitive surfaces that need redaction.

## 3. Secret scanning

- [ ] `pre-commit run --all-files` passes, or the equivalent gitleaks command has
      been run successfully.
- [ ] `.github/workflows/gitleaks.yml` is present and matches the local secret
      scan policy.
- [ ] Any legitimate placeholder or fixture match is documented and justified.
- [ ] No new warnings were introduced by hook configuration changes.
- [ ] `rg "actions/checkout@v4" .github/workflows` returns no matches.

## 4. Rust validation

- [ ] `cargo test -q` passes.
- [ ] Parser hardening regression tests pass, including delta-count normalization and panic-free status handling.
- [ ] `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` passes.
- [ ] `make llvm-cov` passes and the coverage floor remains above the repo
      baseline.
- [ ] Any benchmark or regression gate referenced by the roadmap has its current
      baseline recorded.
- [ ] `INSTALL_MANIFEST.md` only references files/directories that exist in the
      repository and expected install command paths.

## 5. Documentation readiness

- [ ] `README.md` matches the actual build, install, and usage path.
- [ ] `docs/roadmap/implementation-backlog.md` points at the active parity
      roadmap, active issue cards, and archived provenance docs.
- [ ] The active roadmap is
      `docs/roadmap/2026-06-15-rust-tauri-parity-remediation-roadmap.html.md`.
- [ ] The active Beads-ready issue set is
      `docs/roadmap/2026-06-15-rust-tauri-parity-issue-cards.md`.
- [ ] The archived roadmap docs are clearly marked historical only.
- [ ] The roadmap and issue cards reflect the current phase sequencing.
- [ ] Public docs do not promise unsupported features or outdated workflows.
- [ ] Release notes, changelog entries, and user-facing examples are current and
      redaction-safe.

## 6. CI and GitHub readiness

- [ ] `.github/workflows/gitleaks.yml` is green for the publish branch.
- [ ] `.github/workflows/rust-clippy.yml` is green.
- [ ] `.github/workflows/release-please.yml` ignores docs-only and roadmap-only
      pushes so documentation publishes do not churn release refs.
- [ ] `.github/workflows/tachi-mmdc-preflight.yml` is green.
- [ ] `.github/workflows/tachi-pytest.yml` is either retired or scoped strictly to
      transitional compatibility with a documented deprecation plan.
- [ ] Any release workflow required for the branch has succeeded or is queued
      without failures.
- [ ] GitHub Actions status was checked after the last merge or rebase.
- [ ] No workflow emits secrets, private paths, or private data into logs.

## 7. Remote publication

- [ ] The branch to publish is up to date with the intended base branch.
- [ ] The publish commit history is linear or intentionally merged.
- [ ] The push target is `origin/main` or a clearly named release branch.
- [ ] `make publish-gate` runs clean on the branch being published.
- [ ] The post-push CI monitor command is ready, for example:

```bash
gh run list --branch main --limit 10
gh run watch <run-id>
```

## 8. Publish decision

- [ ] The repo is safe to publish.
- [ ] The repo is documented well enough for an outside reader to use.
- [ ] The repo is passing the required validation gates.
- [ ] The repo can be pushed to `origin` without exposing secrets or private
      material.

## Required exit criteria

Do not push to `origin/main` until all of the following are true:

1. Repository hygiene passes.
2. Security and privacy pass.
3. Secret scanning passes.
4. Rust validation passes.
5. Documentation is current.
6. GitHub Actions status is green or understood.

If any item fails, fix the failing gate first and rerun the checklist from the
top.
