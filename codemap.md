# Repository Atlas: tachi-rust

## Project Responsibility

`tachi-rust` is the Rust and Tauri implementation track for Tachi threat-modeling workflows. The current canonical path is the Rust workspace: `tachi-core` owns parsing and report data, `tachi-cli` exposes command-line entrypoints, `tachi-shell` provides shared command handlers, and `src-tauri` keeps the desktop bridge thin.

The repository is still migrating away from the original Python ecosystem. Remaining Python scripts, pytest suites, and FastAPI stack scaffolds are tracked as transitional surfaces in `docs/roadmap/2026-06-08-python-surface-inventory.md`.

## System Entry Points

| Entry Point | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `Cargo.toml` | Workspace manifest for `crates/tachi-core`, `crates/tachi-cli`, `crates/tachi-shell`, and `src-tauri`. |
| `crates/tachi-core/src/lib.rs` | Core Rust library export surface for parsers, report data, coverage-attestation payloads, SARIF builders, taxonomy, coverage audit, infographic payloads, and attack-chain Mermaid generation, including the executive-architecture overlay path. |
| `crates/tachi-cli/src/bin/*.rs` | Rust CLI binaries for init/install/update/bootstrap, report-data, infographic-data, SARIF generation, and coverage audit. |
| `crates/tachi-shell/src/commands.rs` | Shared command layer used by CLI-style flows and the Tauri bridge. |
| `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` | Desktop command registration and bridge integration for Tauri. |
| `Makefile` | Validation shortcuts, including the Rust coverage gate via `make llvm-cov`. |
| `docs/roadmap/` | Canonical migration roadmap, issue cards, merge plan, and Python-surface inventory. |

## Directory Map

| Directory | Responsibility Summary |
|---|---|
| `crates/tachi-core/` | Domain and data-transformation core. It parses generated threat-model artifacts, computes MAESTRO and coverage views, builds report data, emits SARIF payloads, and owns the Rust coverage-audit catalog. |
| `crates/tachi-cli/` | Thin CLI binary layer. Binaries parse flags, call shared core/shell functions, and write files or stdout. Business logic should move down into `tachi-core` or `tachi-shell`. |
| `crates/tachi-shell/` | Shared command facade for shell-style control-plane operations and Tauri-facing command dispatch. Keeps desktop and CLI command semantics aligned. |
| `src-tauri/` | Tauri desktop shell. It should remain a bridge/registration layer and avoid duplicate business logic. |
| `schemas/` | Finding schema and taxonomy catalogs used by parser, source-attribution, coverage, and crosswalk validation tests. |
| `.claude/` | Agent, command, skill, and reference content inherited from the original Tachi workflow. This is data/configuration for threat-modeling behavior, not Rust runtime code. |
| `.aod/` | AOD shell helpers, templates, and governance memory. Some shell helpers remain under Rust test coverage while migration continues. |
| `tests/scripts/` | Transitional pytest suite and fixtures. RT-011 progressively ports high-signal coverage into Rust tests and removes retired pytest modules. |
| `tests/fixtures/` | Frozen fixture copies and baseline trees used for compatibility checks. These are excluded from active coverage-audit counts. |
| `scripts/` | Transitional Python runtime scripts from the original implementation. RT-012 tracks porting remaining canonical behavior into Rust; the standalone SARIF generators, infographic extractor, pagination smoke scaffolds, and attack-chain extraction pytest have already moved to Rust CLI binaries and tests, RT-013 now routes desktop `infographic-data` through the shared Rust payload builder, and the active architecture system-design README now points at the Rust CLI extractors. |
| `stacks/` | Legacy Python/FastAPI and frontend scaffolds. RT-014 tracks retirement or archival after Rust/Tauri parity is stable; the stack index now describes the retired FastAPI packs generically. |
| `docs/` | Public project documentation. Roadmap and product planning documents live under `docs/roadmap/`; testing status lives under `docs/testing/`; archived security-review guidance for retired FastAPI scaffolds lives in `docs/security/`; the root `README.md` now treats the old FastAPI packs and legacy `make test` note as archived guidance, the Rust init matrix workflow has replaced the pytest matrix, live examples use Rust/Tauri or shell tooling instead of Python pretty-printers, and the pre-commit / CLAUDE organization / permissions guidance now avoids Python-specific installation, test-run, and runtime-example wording. |

## Rust Data And Control Flow

1. CLI binaries in `crates/tachi-cli/src/bin/` parse command arguments and delegate to Rust libraries.
2. Shared business logic runs in `tachi-core` modules:
   - `parsers.rs` parses project names, threat findings, markdown tables, source attribution, and agentic patterns.
   - `attack_chains.rs` parses attack-chain artifacts and renders MAESTRO-aligned Mermaid diagrams for Rust-native parity tests.
   - `coverage_attestation.rs` builds the per-finding and per-framework coverage-attestation data for the report pipeline, including raw-versus-in-scope taxonomy counts and filtering helpers.
   - `report_data.rs` builds Typst payload data for report assembly and reuses the already-read threats content for project-name parsing on the hot path.
   - `infographic.rs` builds JSON payloads, MAESTRO visual data, and the executive-architecture overlay path.
   - `risk_scores.rs`, `threats_sarif.rs`, and `sarif_common.rs` build SARIF exports.
   - `coverage_taxonomy.rs` centralizes coverage and MAESTRO taxonomy labels.
   - `coverage_audit.rs` classifies active test modules by unit, integration, smoke, E2E, and support/regression families.
3. `tachi-shell` exposes reusable command functions for shell and desktop paths.
4. `src-tauri` registers desktop commands and dispatches through the shared shell bridge.

## Testing And Validation

| Level | Current Rust-Native Surface |
|---|---|
| Unit | Rust unit tests; current audit shows 1 Rust unit module and 0 remaining Python unit modules. |
| Integration | Rust integration tests under `crates/*/tests` and `src-tauri/tests`; current audit shows 69 Rust integration modules after retiring the defaults-env init, adversarial init, template git clone timeout, executive-architecture infographic, attack-chain, MAESTRO pattern-classification, init precommit matrix, mmdc preflight, PDF page-positioning, backward-compatibility, human-trust-exploitation, extractor contract fixes, coverage-attestation tiers, init constitution, tool-abuse enrichment, pattern-synthesis, ML Top 10 coverage bundle, mobile Top 10 coverage bundle, LLM10 unbounded consumption, coverage-attestation audit, init timing trace, init trace summary, archived FastAPI docs guidance, archived FastAPI getting-started guidance, stack-pack archive pytests, manifest-backed init path caching, and the isolated report-data typst guard while the init-substitution E2E boundary is now Rust-owned. |
| Smoke | Transitional smoke modules tracked by `tachi-core::coverage_audit`; current audit shows 1 Rust smoke canary and 0 remaining Python smoke modules. |
| E2E | Critical init flow now lives in `crates/tachi-shell/tests/init_substitution.rs` while the Rust-owned E2E boundary is being defined. |
| Coverage | `make llvm-cov` is the release-quality local gate. Current validated baseline: 86.36% regions / 86.73% lines. Current audit: 72 active modules, 69 Rust integration modules, 1 Rust unit module, 1 Rust smoke module, 0 support/regression modules. |

Primary validation commands:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
git diff --check
cargo test -q
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
make llvm-cov
cargo run -q -p tachi-cli --bin coverage-audit
```

## Migration Map

| Roadmap Card | Current Direction |
|---|---|
| RT-011 | Complete: migrate remaining pytest coverage into Rust tests using TDD. Keep explicit unit, integration, smoke, and E2E classification visible through `coverage-audit`. |
| RT-012 | Complete: port remaining Python runtime behavior into Rust modules and CLI binaries, especially report extraction, infographic output handling, executive-architecture infographic parity, and remaining report/SARIF payload parity. |
| RT-013 | Complete: keep Tauri shell thin by routing desktop behavior through shared Rust command handlers; `infographic-data` now flows through the shared Rust payload builder. |
| RT-014 | Complete: retire Python packaging, pytest-only guidance, and FastAPI stack scaffolds after parity is complete; the security-review FastAPI scaffold note is archived guidance only, the active architecture and devops README/CI/env-var summaries now point at Rust CLI extractor commands and the Rust init matrix, and the pre-commit / CLAUDE organization / permissions guidance no longer recommends Python-package installation, pytest wording, or Python-runtime environment examples, with the devops local pre-commit path now using a package-manager install example. |
| RT-015 | Optimize Rust path for speed and reliability after the Python runtime path is no longer canonical, with `AOD_INIT_TRACE=1` timing markers in `scripts/init.sh`, a cleanup-phase trace before self-delete, millisecond slowest-phase trace summaries, same-clone cold/warm precommit sample support, and single-read report-data assembly. |

## Dependency Notes

Codemap dependency analysis now treats `scripts/tachi_parsers` as retired. The dead `tests/scripts` init helper package has been retired and the init precommit matrix now lives in `crates/tachi-shell/tests/init_precommit_matrix.rs`; `scripts/init.sh` now exposes opt-in `AOD_INIT_TRACE=1` timing markers plus a cleanup-phase trace and millisecond slowest-phase summaries for the slow-init refinement, scopes placeholder substitution to manifest-backed personalized files plus the constitution clean template, and the workspace inventory now reports no active Python files. The manifest-path cache helper now lives in `crates/tachi-shell/tests/init_manifest_paths.rs` and `scripts/init.sh` reuses the cached personalized path list across substitution and residual scanning. `crates/tachi-core/src/report_data.rs` now reuses the already-read threats content when deriving project metadata so Typst assembly avoids a duplicate filesystem read on the hot path. The security review now treats the remaining FastAPI `SECRET_KEY` note as archived scaffold guidance, not active runtime advice. The stack index and architecture tech-stack table now describe the retired FastAPI packs generically while keeping their historical paths for reference. The init trace harness can now collect cold and warm samples, with and without precommit, in the same clone by restoring `scripts/init.sh` between runs, and the active pre-commit, CLAUDE organization, and permissions guidance now keeps installation, testing, and runtime-example wording package-manager-only or Rust-native. The Rust init matrix workflow now replaces the pytest matrix, and the active devops README/env-var summaries, smoke guide, orchestration skill doc, root README, and getting-started / eval-convention live docs now use Rust/Tauri or shell tooling instead of Python pretty-printers or legacy pytest guidance. Rust work should continue moving any remaining parser-like behavior into `tachi-core` or `tachi-shell` with Rust tests. The FastAPI Alembic scaffold `env.py` files, backend test-package scaffolding, backend app runtime trees, backend scaffold packaging manifests, backend Alembic scaffold directories/manifests, root pytest support package, and top-level Python packaging manifests (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements-dev.txt`) are also retired and should stay out of the active Python surface inventory.

## Agent Guidance

- Before changing code, read this file and the relevant Rust module/test files.
- Prefer small TDD slices with one retired Python surface per commit.
- Use `.worktrees/` for isolated branches; it is ignored by git.
- Treat roadmap documents under `docs/roadmap/` as the canonical migration status.
- Keep `README.md` at repository root and move non-root Markdown documentation under `docs/` unless it is standard project metadata.
