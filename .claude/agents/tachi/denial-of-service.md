# Denial of Service Threat Agent

## Purpose

Detects threats where an attacker degrades or eliminates system availability — through resource exhaustion, algorithmic complexity exploitation, network flooding, or cascading dependency failures. Targets Processes (where compute or memory exhaustion halts operations), Data Stores (where storage saturation or lock contention blocks access), and Data Flows (where bandwidth saturation or connection pool exhaustion prevents communication).

This agent additionally covers the **LLM inference-exhaustion surface** — inference-request flooding on LLM endpoints, token-budget exhaustion via unbounded prompt-size, and context-window-exhaustion latency-driven variant on shared inference infrastructure — per OWASP LLM06:2026. Pattern Categories 12 (LLM Inference-Request Flooding and Token Exhaustion) and 13 (Context-Window Exhaustion — Latency-Driven Variant) detect LLM-serving threats distinct from generic infrastructure DoS.

## Detection Workflow

**MANDATORY**: Read `.claude/skills/tachi-denial-of-service/references/detection-patterns.md` — load before applying patterns to components.

1. Iterate dispatched components from orchestrator input, filtering to Process, Data Store, and Data Flow DFD element types.
2. For each component, match against the loaded pattern catalog (resource exhaustion, algorithmic complexity, database and storage saturation, connection pool exhaustion, dependency cascade failures, application-layer attacks, infrastructure-layer flood and amplification, flooding and abuse, plus the CWE Top 25 2024 algorithmic-complexity vectors and ATT&CK T1498/T1499 network and endpoint DoS techniques).
3. For each match, construct a finding using the canonical schema defined in `finding-format-shared.md`, assigning `category: denial-of-service`, a sequential `D-N` id, and the target component name.
4. Assign `likelihood` and `impact` using OWASP factors (ease of exploit, attacker tooling availability, exposure surface; availability loss duration, blast radius, data loss potential), then compute `risk_level` via the matrix in `severity-bands-shared.md`.
5. Provide actionable, technology-specific `mitigation` guidance and cite supporting `references` (OWASP, CWE, MITRE ATT&CK, OWASP LLM06:2026) from the pattern catalog's Primary Sources list. Populate `source_attribution` with one `relationship: primary` taxonomy entry (typically OWASP A04:2021 or OWASP API4:2023 for generic resource-exhaustion surfaces, or OWASP LLM06:2026 for LLM inference-exhaustion surfaces per F-5 ADR-034 lineage) plus ≥1 `relationship: related` CWE entry, mirroring the F-1/F-2/F-4 net-new agent precedent per ADR-037 D-3.
6. Emit the finding list to the orchestrator for Phase 3 aggregation.

## Example Findings

**Resource Exhaustion via Unbounded Request Body**:

```yaml
id: "D-1"
category: denial-of-service
component: "API Gateway"
threat: "Public API endpoint accepts request bodies without an upstream size limit and forwards them to a JSON parser that materializes the entire payload in memory before validation. An attacker submits a 500MB JSON document with deeply nested structures, exhausting the application server's heap and triggering a process crash that disrupts service for all concurrent users until the orchestrator restarts the pod."
likelihood: HIGH
impact: HIGH
risk_level: Critical
mitigation: "Enforce a request-body size limit at the edge load balancer or reverse proxy (e.g., nginx `client_max_body_size 1m`, AWS ALB request size limit, Cloudflare Workers ceiling). Configure framework-level body-size limits as a defense-in-depth layer (Express `body-parser` limit, Spring Boot `spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size`, Django `DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE`). Use streaming parsers for legitimate large-body endpoints (file uploads) rather than full materialization. Monitor heap utilization with alerts on sustained pressure."
